        <p> In a fast-evolving eCommerce landscape, apart from great products and frequent innovation, what users want to see is the kind of collaborations and partnerships a brand establishes.

        These reveal the general direction the brand is trying to evolve in and also put the spotlight on special efforts to make its products more differentiated and desirable. Put more simply, partnerships and collaborations reveal that a brand exists for reasons beyond the material and transactional.
